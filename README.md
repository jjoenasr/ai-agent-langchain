# LangChain Agent with Gradio Interface

A powerful conversational AI agent built with LangChain, Google's Gemini LLM, and Gradio interface. The agent can perform multiple tasks including weather checks, movie information retrieval, web searches, and more.

## Features

- ü§ñ Interactive chat interface using Gradio
- üõ†Ô∏è Multiple tool integration:
  - Weather information retrieval
  - Now playing movies in theaters
  - Web search using DuckDuckGo
  - Hugging Face Hub model statistics
  - Guest information retrieval using semantic vector similarity
- üìù Real-time streaming responses
- üîç Transparent tool usage display
- üíæ Memory management for conversation context

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed and the following API keys:
- Google API key (for Gemini LLM)
- OpenWeatherMap API key
- TMDB API key (for movie information)
- Tavily API key (for web searches)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
OPEN_WEATHER_MAP=your_openweathermap_key
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key
```

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

The Gradio interface will launch in your default web browser, allowing you to:
- Chat with the AI agent
- See tool usage in real-time
- Copy conversation messages
- Clear the chat history
